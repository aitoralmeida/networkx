Flat Merge version of DEMON (Democratic Estimate of the Modular Organization of

Michele Coscia, Giulio Rossetti, Fosca Giannotti, Dino Pedreschi:
DEMON: a local-first discovery method for overlapping communities.
KDD 2012:615-623

DEMON uses a local-first approach to community discovery were each node
democratically votes for the communities that it sees in its surroundings. It 
provides a deterministic, fully incremental method for community discovery that
has a limited time complexity.

Based on the implementation by Giulio Rossetti <giulio.rossetti@isti.cnr.it>:

    uses a local-first approach to community discovery were each node

    Algorithm:
    ----------

    1: for all v in V do:

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        An NetworkX graph. 
    
    epsilon: real
        The tolerance required in order to merge communities. The epsilon 
        factor is introduced to vary the percentage of common elements provided 
        from each couple of communities: epsilon = 0 ensure that two 
        communities are merged only if one of them is a proper subset of the 
        other, on the other hand with a value of epsilon = 1 even communities 
        that do not share a single node are merged together
    
    min_community_size: integer
        Min nodes needed to form a community
    
    weight: String
        If the graph is weighted, the edge parameter representing the weight
     
    
    Returns
    -------
    communities : list
