Flat Merge version of DEMON (Democratic Estimate of the Modular Organization of

were each node democratically votes for the communities that it sees in its
surroundings. It provides a deterministic, fully incremental method for 
community discovery that has a limited time complexity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX graph.

    epsilon: real
        The tolerance required in order to merge communities. The epsilon
        factor is introduced to vary the percentage of common elements provided
        from each couple of communities: epsilon = 0 ensure that two
        communities are merged only if one of them is a proper subset of the
        other, on the other hand with a value of epsilon = 1 even communities
        that do not share a single node are merged together

    min_community_size: integer
        Min nodes needed to form a community

    weight: String
        If the graph is weighted, the edge parameter representing the weight

    Returns
    -------
    communities : list
        List of overlapping communities (sets)
