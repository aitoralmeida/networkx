    """
    Asynchronous label propagation algorithm for community detection described
    on [1]_. The algorithm is non-deterministic and the found communities may
    vary on different executions.
    
    The algorithm follows these steps:
        
        1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network giving them unique
        identifiers.
        2. Set t=1.
        3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to X.
        4. For each x in X chosen in that specific order, get the label 
        occurring with the highest frecuency among neighbors. Ties are broken
        uniformly randomly.
        5. If every node has a label that the maximun number of their neighbors
        have, then stop the algorithm. Else set t = t+1 and got to (3).

    Modified to be able to take into account the edge weights when assigning
    the labels to one node.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        Network to be processed
        
    weight : string
        If the graph is weighted, the edge parameter representing the weight.
        If left to None edge weights are not taken into account.
         
    Returns
    -------
    communities : list
        List of communities (sets)
